`The old years that held and fashioned me' (1870-1889)
The family into which Lord Alfred Douglas was born was one of the noblest houses in Scotland. They had a colourful history and had once possessed great lands, wealth and influence. Towards the end of the eighth century, tradition has it that a chieftain, or king, whose army was losing in battle saw the tide turned in his favour by an unknown warrior. He sent for the man after the battle had been won, and the soldier who conducted him into his presence said, `Sholto Du-glass. Behold the dark grey man you inquired for.'
    A Sir William Douglas died in the Tower of London in 1298 and was succeeded by his son James, Lord of Douglas. But the man who most made a name for the family in its early years was William the `Black Douglas', nephew of James, who was renowned for having fought in seventy battles. As a friend of Robert the Bruce, it was the Black Douglas who attempted to fulfil that King's dying wish that his heart be taken to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem in a silver casket. It was while engaged on this mission that the Black Douglas met his end. He had travelled with the heart on one of the Crusades but was killed in Spain by the Moors in 1390 before he reached the Holy Land. The Black Douglas's remains were buried, in Melrose Abbey, along with the silver casket containing his friend's heart. It is commemorated in the Douglas coat-of-arms, which bears a heart along with the word `Forward'. Although his final mission was unsuccessful, the Black Douglas has remained one of the best-known figures in his country's legend. The fierceness and determination that characterised his career emerged in the lives of many of his descendants, along with the gore and sensation.
    James I of Scotland conferred the barony of Drumlanrig on the illegitimate son of the 2nd Earl of Douglas, who was killed at the battle of Chevy Chase while fighting the English in 1388, but it was James I of England who, in gratitude for his hospitality in 1617, created the 9th Baron the Duke of Queensberry, Viscount Drumlanrig and Lord Douglas of Hawick and Tibbers. The second of these titles became the courtesy title by which the eldest son of each Queensberry was known, while the third was often bestowed upon the second son. The complex succession that went on in the family meant that titles often came and went or they were dispersed.
    The numbering of the Queensberrys' titles changed after the Second World War, when the 10th Marquess became the 11th. This came about because James, the son of the 2nd Duke of Queensberry, had originally been overlooked: he was reputed to have been `an idiot from birth'. He became famous as the `cannibalistic idiot' after an incident in 1707 when he was left alone by his guards in his cell at Holyrood Palace. They planned to watch the riots then taking place in Edinburgh over the Act of Union debate. The `idiot' escaped and went into the kitchens where he found a cook's boy turning a spit. He seized and killed the boy, then impaled him on the spit and roasted him before the fire. On his father's death, all titles and estates went to his younger brother, who became the 3rd (revised as the 4th) Marquess of Queensberry in 1711. The `idiot' died at the age of seventeen.
    The title Viscount Drumlanrig is reputed by some family members and many others to carry a curse, even for those heirs who do not use it. The 3rd Duke lost his heir while the family, including Drumlanrig's wife, was travelling. Fearing an attack from highwaymen the young man prepared his pistol, but the charge exploded by accident and killed him in the carriage. Another Drumlanrig drowned when he attempted to jump a wide river with his horse and both fell in. Other holders of the title, according to one of their descendants, drank themselves into early graves. The early and often violent deaths that had plagued the family were not only confined to its heirs, though. The 7th Marquess died on 6 August 1858 while out shooting rabbits from the `accidental explosion of his gun'. However, the national press speculated about the incident: the Evening Herald reported that `in sporting circles a belief is expressed that the death was not accidental; he had recently sustained severe losses', and popular opinion seemed to hold that the Marquess had committed suicide.
    However, the family enjoyed some happier, if not entirely reputable, moments in their history. The 3rd Duke and his wife (who had seen their son die in their carriage) were friends and patrons of Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, William Congreve and John Gay among others. Gay's masterpiece The Beggar's Opera was written at their house, and they argued with George II over his refusal to grant a licence for its sequel, Polly, which, it was claimed, ridiculed Walpole's ministry. The 3rd Duke's cousin, the 4th and last Duke of Queensberry, was the notorious `Regency Rake' who became known as `Old Q'. He was one of the most important members of the Hell-Fire Club, the `Monks of Medmenham'. It was founded by Francis Dashwood, a close friend of George III, met in a restored Cistercian abbey and was filled with Old Etonians. At their meetings the mock-religious order performed acts of devil worship, with Dashwood in the role of Christ, using blasphemy and the black mass as `sexual stimulants'. However, it seems that what excited Old Q was not so much the perversions, but sex itself: he was sexually active right up to his death at the age of eighty-five when his grave was littered with around seventy letters from various women containing `open avowals of their adoration or passion'  which were gathered together and burnt. He died unmarried and without any recognised issue to succeed him. The dukedom passed to a distant kinsman, the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. The marquessate, however, passed to the Kelhead line of the house of Douglas, and Sir Charles Douglas, Bt, a descendant of the 1st Earl of Queensberry, became the 5th Marquess of Queensberry.
    He never produced a male heir, although he had eight daughters, so on his death the titles went to his brother John, the 6th Marquess. He and his wife Sarah had two children, a boy and a girl. Their son, Archibald William Douglas, succeeded to the title at the age of thirty-six. He had eloped to Gretna Green when he was just twenty-one to marry Caroline Clayton, the one romantic and interesting episode in an otherwise rather dull and unhappy life. He continued to call himself Viscount Drumlanrig, despite the `curse', and survived his father by only two years. It was he who was found dead with his gun. He was the grandfather of Lord Alfred Douglas.
    The 7th Marquess had six children. His first child was a daughter, Gertrude, and the second was his son and heir. John Sholto must have found his father's untimely death especially distressing as he became head of the family at the age of just fourteen. In 1865 his younger brother Francis who was just eighteen was involved in a mountaineering accident on the first climb of the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps. He had set off with a party of eight, mainly experienced climbers. Progress was easy on the way up and the party beat the Italian team competing against them to be first to the summit. It was during the descent, while trying to negotiate a rocky shoulder on the east face, that disaster struck. The guides had omitted to rope the party firmly together, and the most inexperienced lost his footing and slipped. As he fell he crashed into another climber. Both men tumbled over the cliff, pulling Francis Douglas, who hurtled down four thousand feet of rocky precipices.
    There was no way that any of the men could survive such a fall but the subsequent search found only three unrecognisably battered bodies, identifiable only by their clothing. Francis Douglas was never found, even though his elder brother went out to help with the search. Queensberry went ahead of the party and spent a night alone on the mountain searching for his brother's body, coming close to dying from the terrible cold and continual avalanches. Amazed by the force of nature and its ability to take as well as to give life, Queensberry found himself contemplating `the relation of the body and soul of man', which eventually formed the basis of his atheistic beliefs that while man had the opportunity of eternal life he was not subservient to a god. He expressed his ideas as best he could in a poem many years later, although a more eloquent tribute to the dead mountaineers came in the form of a sonnet about the event by Thomas Hardy. In the wake of Francis's death, Queen Victoria considered banning mountaineering among her subjects.
    Queensberry's atheism became more radical as the years passed: asked as one of the Scottish representative peers in the House of Lords to swear the oath of allegiance to God and the Queen, he refused, saying he would not take part in such `Christian tomfoolery' and that his word should be enough. As a result he was not allowed to take his seat, a decision for which the Prime Minister, Gladstone, apologised. However, as a direct result of this, he was offered the presidency of the British Secular Union and promptly accepted it.
    His opinions remained in the public domain and he attracted the limelight again when he tried to stop the third performance of the Poet Laureate's The Promise of May. Audiences generally had not reacted well to Tennyson's play and on the first night there had been booing and hissing from a group of atheists objecting to one of the characters, the evil Philip Edgar, an atheist, radical and hedonist, On the night Queensberry took his seat in the front row of the stalls he objected forcefully to the depiction of the atheist and was shouted down. When the scene drew to a close he attempted to explain his feelings to the audience but was promptly ejected from the theatre. Otherwise his life was uneventful, although the Queensberry Rules of boxing took their name from him, and remained the most important development in the sport for many years, and he was a renowned sportsman. However, his greatest ambition, to ride in the Grand National and win, was scuppered when his cousin, who owned what turned out to be the winning horse, deemed Queensberry past his best. Queensberry never forgave him.
    The insanity that regularly affected the Queensberry family perhaps most obviously afflicted Queensberry's youngest brother, James (or Jim), who was deeply attached to his twin sister Florrie and heartbroken when she married Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie (Sir A.B.C.D. or `Beau' for short) in 1875. After his attempt to abduct a young girl in 1885, James became increasingly manic. In 1888 he was married to a wealthy woman of his own age with a ten-year-old son and a vast fortune. The union was a disaster from the outset. James was not able to play out the role of Victorian husband and, separated from Florrie, who was in Scotland while he was in London, he drank himself into a deep depression.
* * *
The woman whom the 8th Marquess of Queensberry took as his wife was quite as determined as the best of the Douglas family members. She was the daughter of Alfred Montgomery, the son of an officer in the East India Company's military service. Born in 1814 and educated at Charterhouse, where he was a contemporary of Thackeray, at the age of sixteen Alfred Montgomery became private secretary to the Marquess of Wellesley, the elder brother of the Duke of Wellington. Wellesley was deeply attached to Alfred's mother, and it was widely rumoured that his choice of private secretary had been influenced by his suspicion that he was the boy's father. Alfred was generally believed to bear a striking similarity in appearance to Wellesley (and if it were true then it would make Lord Alfred Douglas the great-great-nephew of the Iron Duke). He was perhaps best known during his lifetime as a magnificent wit and entertainer. Lisping, stuttering and effete, he was considered a fine conversationalist and companion. It seemed unlikely that he would marry and there are grounds for suspecting that he was homosexual. (His son-in-law, the 8th Marquess, thought he was and it seems had fairly good proof of his suspicion: in later years he implied this strongly, which he would not have done without considerable substantiating evidence.) Certainly the marriage, less than three weeks after Wellesley's death, surprised everyone.
    Alfred and his wife, Fanny Wyndham, had little in common. A cousin of the poet Wilfred Scawen Blunt, her family were odd to say the least, with some members being marked by bizarre persecution mania or behavioural habits which kept them from being prominent in society. The couple had two daughters, Sibyl and Edith. Their first child, a boy named Wilfred, died at the age of six.
    The marriage of Queensberry and Sibyl Montgomery was also not ideal by any means. Queensberry was attracted to her great beauty: she was delicate and vulnerable-looking, which in many men would stir feelings of protectiveness, though not, as it turned out, in Queensberry. Nevertheless he was totally in love with her and although Alfred Montgomery must have been wary of giving his daughter to the hearty Queensberry, any qualms were laid to rest by the idea that his daughter would become a marchioness, a social advancement that he and his family could not readily turn down.
    So, both aged twenty-one, Queensberry and Sibyl married at St George's Church, Hanover Square on Thursday 26 February 1866. The wedding had been planned to take place four days earlier but an uncle of Sibyl's died suddenly and it was postponed. Many of the guests on the impressive list were unable to attend the rearranged service, which was something of a damp squib. It was not a promising start to the marriage.
    The bride and groom took a short honeymoon in Essex then headed straight for the family seat of Kinmount in Dumfriesshire. Their arrival there at the end of the Scottish winter cannot have made the bride particularly happy. Kinmount had been built to a neo-classical design in 1812 for the 6th Marquess. With its lakes, woods and rolling borderland landscape, the house looked serene in the finest weather but in the cold and damp of a Scottish winter it was bleak and forbidding.
    Queensberry took his role as squire seriously. He became Master of the Dumfriesshire Foxhounds and spent much of his time riding and enjoying country life. Within a year of the marriage the couple's first child was born, which delighted both of them, not least because it was a boy and therefore an heir. In memory of his uncle, they named him Francis.
    By the time Sibyl was pregnant again the following year, things had started to go badly wrong between the Queensberrys, as her mother reported to her friend, the Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, during a stay at Kinmount. Queensberry, she wrote, was `very young; only 23. With good abilities and good principles, but suffering from the overwhelming weight of high rank and nothing to do.' Their second son, Percy, was born in 1868, and soon afterwards Queensberry decided to follow his interest in Midlands hunting. In 1869 he moved his stables and his family to Worcestershire where he rented a house called Ham Hill. It was at that house, on 22 October 1870, that their third son was born, Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas.

Alfred arrived at a time of particular loneliness in Sibyl's life, and was adored by her over all her children. He became a replacement for her absent husband. Queensberry had just become Master of the Worcestershire Foxhounds and never missed a day in the field, leaving at dawn and returning at dusk. Consequently he spent no time with his wife or children.
    Alfred had been named after his Montgomery grandfather and his godfather, Lord Robert Bruce, who had been a friend of Queensberry since they were in the Royal Navy together as young men. The combination of the two names is significant. Alfred had inherited the good looks of the Montgomerys, and particularly resembled his grandfather, but his temperament was a mass of contradictions: he soon showed himself to be a forceful and determined fighter, a wit and a dandy.
    After two years at Ham Hill, Queensberry resigned his Mastership and took the family back up to Kinmount, and it was from there that Alfred Douglas's earliest memories dated. They centred, of course, on his brothers and mother. According to Douglas, throughout his childhood he held an `intense' admiration for his father, which, he wrote, `was doubtless not at all impaired, but on the contrary greatly increased, by the fact that I hardly ever saw him'. He recorded that Queensberry's children did not see their father for several years at a time, for he was chasing other women as well as the fox and stag. The birth of another son, Sholto, in 1872, and a daughter, Edith, in 1874, did nothing to patch up the relationship between the Marquess and his wife.
    However, in his early years at Kinmount life was undoubtedly something like Eden to young Alfred. In those days the family had money, land, influence, power and hordes of servants to care for them and the estate. The impression that all the children retained of their time at Kinmount was one of adventure. Among the rolling woods and lakes lay areas to explore, and a smaller house, owned by the family and hidden among the woods, Glen Stewart, was home to the children's grandmother, the Dowager Marchioness, and later to their aunt Florrie and Beau.
    At the age of six Queensberry gave Alfred a pony, which afforded him the opportunity to explore further afield. With Percy, he rode around the estate and up to Glen Stewart. The pair were particularly good friends as well as brothers, and the shared sense of adventure in their youth set the tone of their relationship for the rest of their lives. Together they rode to the village of Ecclefechan where Thomas Carlyle (who was still alive) had been born. There they purchased toy swords with which they carried out reconstructions of their ancestors' feats. On one occasion the game went wrong when Percy almost stabbed out his elder brother Drumlanrig's eye.
    It was in these early years that Alfred acquired the nickname by which his family and friends always called him. His mother liked to call him by the West Country diminutive `Boysie', meaning simply `little boy', which gradually shortened to `Bosie'. It was used all his life, and is curiously apt for, in so many ways, he remained at heart a little boy until his death.
* * *
By the end of the 1870s Queensberry was living in London, apart from his family, but it was not until the next decade that he decided to sell Kinmount. It was a selfish decision that upset the children and his wife. Sibyl, however, would not allow the children to think ill of their father: she wanted them to grow up to love and admire him even if she could not.
    While the family were settled in London, Alfred and his eldest brother Francis were sent to Lambrook, a prep school near Windsor. It was not especially eminent, but the children there were all of the aristocracy or royalty  including two of Queen Victoria's grandsons, Prince Victor and Prince Albert of Schleswig-Holstein. The Queen herself often went to the school from the castle to watch the cricket. Its geographical situation meant that it was a natural feeder for Eton  clearly the path considered at some time for young Alfred.
    Francis was only at the school for a term, until he was old enough to go to Harrow, which he did in January 1881. This was against Queensberry's wishes: he wanted his children to go to Scottish schools, even though he had no knowledge of them since he had gone to naval school. Francis did not excel at Harrow. `He was not a brilliant athlete, nor a distinguished scholar, but one of the larger class of those who make no special mark in work or games, but leave with all their friends pleasant recollections of an honest, strong and upright character, an unfailing cheerfulness, courtesy, and a kindly unassuming demeanour.'
    Education at Lambrook must have come as a shock to Alfred after his private lessons at Kinmount. Nevertheless he was happy there. It was therefore with dismay that he faced a sudden change just as he had settled down: after only a year he was forced to leave. What he later termed `a row' took place. The nature of this is not clear and he says he did not know at the time and did not discover for many years afterwards what had happened.  His unwillingness to write or speak about it even fifty or so years later hints that it must have been something serious, perhaps a homosexual scandal, although he certainly was not involved. In fact, it was serious enough for almost every child to leave and the school nearly closed down. Instead Alfred was sent to Wixenford School with his younger brother Sholto. He stayed there for three years.
    The few memories he recorded of his time at Wixenford are sketchy. He recalled the headmaster whom he found `very alarming', and who he thought picked on him, yet he also said that there was almost no punishment, and his days seemed to have passed smoothly enough.  He wrote, too, that he was a `very sensitive' child, and blamed this on his mother, who had made him `frightfully spoilt'. As a result, he `suffer[ed] proportionately more at school'.  He made one particularly good friend there in Edward Francis Shepherd, an American. Alfred was entranced by Shepherd's accent, which he had never encountered before, and though the other boy was slightly older, the two became close. They parted with sadness when Shepherd left for Eton in 1883.
    The separation of Alfred Douglas and Edward Shepherd had not been intended to be permanent, though. Lady Queensberry had put her son down for Eton some time before he was of the age to enter the school, but when Queensberry heard of his wife's plan, he deemed it inappropriate that he had not been consulted and refused to give his consent. He said that he would not have any son of his turned into a `Belgravian loafer', which Douglas said later, `was his quaint expression for what he imagined to be the typical and representative results of education at that celebrated school'. Queensberry knew nothing whatsoever about Eton or any other public school, but `his prejudices once formed were as insurmountable as they were often unreasonable'. Doubtless his decision was based largely on a desire to show his family that he held sway over them even though he saw them so rarely. Inevitably he had his own way and decided that Alfred should go to Winchester, an odd choice since it was further from home than many other appropriate schools (although this might have been the attraction) and because the family had had no previous contact with the school.
    Without knowing it, Queensberry was casting the most sensitive and vulnerable of his sons into something of a lion's den. Douglas recalled later that his first two years at Winchester were `a nightmare'. The school was in the process of being `cleaned up' when he arrived but still bore a strong resemblance to the Rugby of Tom Brown's Schooldays. Bullying was rife, older boys exploiting younger boys, while many cases of torture are recorded. At this point Winchester still had a long way to go before it was dragged into the nineteenth century. Also homosexual activity was rampant.
    By then Alfred had exceptional, somewhat feminine good looks. His hair was silky blond, with the faintest hint of curl, his complexion clear and smooth, his lips sensual and his eyes a bright blue. Boys who looked like him were particularly susceptible to attention from their seniors. It is clear that he despised this at first, though after a while he fell into form and it later became a great asset to him.
    He only named one boy with whom he had been to bed during his time at Winchester and this was certainly not a sexual encounter. During one summer holiday Alfred went with his housemaster, Trant Bramston and his best schoolfriend, Viscount Encombe (nicknamed `Jane'), to Zermatt in Switzerland, perhaps so that Douglas might see where his uncle had met his end nearly twenty years earlier. Whatever the justification for the trip, it seems to have been a success. However, when he got home to his mother and siblings, he developed mumps. Another great friend was one Wellington Stapleton Cotton who was at Wellington College. Alfred and Wellington were keen to spend time together before they returned to their respective schools, but Alfred's mumps prevented a meeting. The friends were not to be separated so easily, though. Through a footman, Alfred pointed out to Wellington that if he got mumps too they would be together and urged him to come to see him despite the prohibition of their mothers. The next morning Wellington climbed through Alfred's bedroom window, got into bed with him and stayed there for half an hour to ensure he caught mumps. The plan failed: Wellington remained healthy, but Encombe went back to Winchester and infected his whole house, who then infected the rest of the school.
    Encombe was a most loyal friend to Douglas during his career at school, university and after. He was the heir of the 3rd Earl of Eldon, and the grandson of the famous Lord Chancellor. The two got to know each other well because they were in the same house at school and, although they had a strong relationship, it was not what Douglas would later term `immoral'. In his Autobiography (1929) Douglas set down the three types of relationships that he enjoyed with other boys during his time at Winchester and Oxford.
... I had many fine friendships, perfectly normal, wholesome, and not in the least sentimental. Such was my friendship with Encombe ... I had other friendships which were sentimental and passionate, but perfectly pure and innocent. Such was my friendship with Wellington Stapleton Cotton. I had others again which were neither pure nor innocent. But if it is to be assumed from this that I was `abnormal' or `degenerate' or exceptionally wicked, then it must also be assumed that at least ninety per cent of my contemporaries at Winchester and Oxford were the same.
    Friendships like those he shared with Encombe and Stapleton Cotton were rare; the most common were those that were `neither pure nor innocent', which went largely unrecorded. Forty years later, Douglas was exceptionally brave in admitting to having practised acts that might have consigned him to prison. Few mainstream published books from the period record so candidly an author's admission of homosexual activity. Of course, others wrote accounts of life at public school but only one recorded in detail what could never have been published.
    The most famous among Douglas's contemporaries who recorded in detail his sexual activity at school, and afterwards, was Sir Edmund Trelawny Backhouse. His scabrous, unpublished, Autobiography, written in Peking in 1943, should be treated with caution: he wrote that his six years at Winchester were `a carnival of unbridled lust', and claimed to have had sexual relationships with more than thirty boys during his time there, including Alfred Douglas. There is proof that some of his claims were not true, but in 1943, the year before his death, and two years before Douglas's, Backhouse claimed that, `Bozie (sic) would probably not thank me for recalling numerous love episodes at Winchester in which he was usually the ascendant and I the pathic, although positions were sometimes reversed.'
    By his third year at Winchester, Alfred was accustomed to this way of life, which probably helped him become at Oxford the most prominent homosexual in the university, among those in the know. Nevertheless, buggery almost certainly did not take place between the Winchester boys and it seems that when they had `immoral relationships' with other boys they probably went no further than mutual masturbation.
    At Winchester, it was more than just the sexual preferences of his contemporaries that rubbed off on Alfred. He arrived at the school with a firm religious faith. Doubts about the existence of God or rebellion against the respect that the Church demanded were simply not considered, and the irreverent behaviour of some older boys in his house shocked him considerably:
There was a picture of The Last Supper (a reproduction of Da Vinci's picture) hanging over the `high table' of our House. One of the boys who was a prefect, and certainly the most powerful and influential boy in the House (he was in `Commoner Six' at football and in the school eleven), used to make a practice of hurling a piece of bread at this picture every time he came in to tea (there being no master then present), his object being to hit the figure of Our Lord.
    More painful still, though, was the loss of innocence, which for the rest of his life Douglas tried to regain, striving once again to be in the godly state of childhood:
I bitterly resent that I was robbed of my virtue and my innocence in my helpless boyhood, by being put into a community which one of its most distinguished sons compared to hell.  If I had escaped untarnished from Winchester and Oxford it would have been a miracle, and I would have been a saint.
    Douglas was not a saint, though, so his behaviour and attitude were, as he wrote, `neither better nor worse than my contemporaries  that is to say, [I became] a finished young blackguard, ripe for any kind of wickedness'.
    All this gives the impression that life at school was hell for Douglas, but this is not so. After the Autobiography had been published and a biography of him had stated that Douglas loathed his schooldays, he wrote of Winchester in Without Apology, `The plain truth is that, except for about three months before and after my marriage, I have never really been perfectly happy since I left it, and that to this day my most enchanting dream, which comes from time to time even now, is that I am still there.' Part of the reason that he could write this was to do with his circle of close friends: Lord Encombe, whom he always took to tea when his grandfather, Alfred Montgomery, visited him at school; and `Sunny' Marlborough, or Viscount Blandford as he was during his schooldays. (He became the 9th Duke of Marlborough when he was just twenty. He was known as Sunny all his life, though not, as one writer has pointed out, due to any `sunny disposition', but rather because his father's subsidiary courtesy title was Earl of Sunderland.)
    For a variety of reasons, Douglas was popular at school, and certainly not the `mummy's boy' that some have thought. In fact he excelled in artistic, aesthetic and sporting endeavours. He was affectionately known as either `Alf' or `Bosie' by everyone in his house. The nickname had slipped out one day during his first or second year at Winchester. His elder brother Percy had joined the Navy and was about to sail for the Pacific. He sent a telegram to his younger brother which said simply, `Good-bye, darling Bosie'. It was left for him on a table in Hall while he was out, but before he returned temptation proved too much for another boy. When Douglas got back he was hailed with derisive shouts, `"Hello, darling Bosie,"' and Bosie he remained, through school, university and beyond.

As a boy, Douglas was proud of his family, whose fame and prominence impressed many of his contemporaries. At that time his eccentric aunt Florrie was making a name for herself as an explorer. From her first expedition, to Patagonia, she brought home a jaguar, which she kept as a pet and called Affums. Florrie claimed that Affums was `as friendly as a kitten', though discouraged her nephew from trying to stroke it while it was on its chain in the garden. One day Affums escaped, and found its way to Windsor park where it killed several deer, much to the annoyance of Queen Victoria, who `made such remonstrances' that when it was recaptured Florrie had to send it to the zoo. She, Beau and her brother Jim would often climb into its cage for a chat.
    Home life remained unconventional and it was during his last years at Winchester that Douglas recognised his father for what he was. During school holidays he and his younger sister Edith would spend a couple of weeks with their father in lodgings in Brighton. It was obvious to them that they bored Queensberry: he would suggest they go to the pier and amuse themselves, dishing out sums of money that were `grossly in excess of what would have been sufficient for the purpose'.  Sibyl lived at a house near Bracknell in Berkshire called The Hut, whose name gives no hint of its impressive size, where Queensberry spent no more than a few nights a year. When he did turn up he caused trouble.
    On one occasion Sibyl was powerless to prevent her children witnessing his brutality. It was probably this incident that began to turn his children against him. The Hut was near Ascot, and when Alfred was sixteen his mother had arranged for friends to make up a house party during race week. Twenty-four hours before the guests were due Queensberry turned up with a party of his own friends, including his mistress. Sibyl, humiliated, had to put off her guests. From then relations in the family were at breaking point. Queensberry's attempt at a resolution included his suggestion that Sibyl move in with him and his mistress. The following year, 1887, Lady Queensberry petitioned for divorce on the grounds of adultery and cruelty. It was granted without challenge.
    If Queensberry ever beat his children it is not recorded, and it seems that his violence towards his wife came in the form of threatening letters, which she received with increasing regularity after the divorce. He found it difficult to communicate with his children. Alfred recorded that from the age of twelve his father talked to him as though he was an adult, repeatedly expressing concern at his brother Jim's drinking  reportedly as many as four bottles of brandy a day on top of the claret, port and champagne he consumed at meals. Conversation initiated by his son, or anyone else, was generally received with a `stony silence'.
    As a boy at Winchester, Douglas always admired and even loved his distant father. He recorded that one of his favourite pastimes was to go to the house library and read through the bound set of old numbers of the Field to find references to his father's racing successes in the 1860s and 1870s.
    Queensberry's sporting prowess was probably behind his son's greatest achievement at Winchester: he won the school steeplechase of two and a half miles across country in a record time. Queensberry rewarded him with five pounds, a vast amount then for a schoolboy to receive, but then, as Douglas had already realised, Queensberry had `no idea what was the right amount of money to give a boy'.
    It was during the summer of 1887 that Douglas had what was perhaps his most intense emotional relationship during his time at school. It is unlikely that it had a sexual side since he was confident enough of its purity to devote a whole chapter to it in his 1938 book of memoirs Without Apology. Eighteen eighty-seven was the year of the Queen's Golden Jubilee, which Douglas described as `the star-year of my eternity'. Boys of different houses did not generally mix, and older boys certainly had no communication with younger ones of another house, and but for a bout of German measles that confined sufferers to the `Sick-House', the boys would never have met.
    German measles lasted only a few days but the boys were quarantined for three weeks, and it was during the first days of his illness that Douglas set eyes on Maurice Turner, who was two years younger and the son of a housemaster: `a violent mutual attraction sprang up'. No work was set for patients in the sick-house and only the school matron (the `kind and delightful' Miss D'Arcy) and the maids were around. They could pass the time in long walks on the school fields, which they had to themselves while everyone else was in lessons, and talking. Maurice was still a child and liked to sing to Douglas the songs he had learnt in the nursery. The boys became inseparable, basking in the sunshine, drinking bottles of ginger beer and telling each other stories.
    One morning Douglas realised that he had not seen Maurice since breakfast and surmised that he had returned to normal school life. He was devastated. `We both thought,' he wrote, `that he would be there at least another day, which in mid-summer at school is an eternity.' Soon one of the maids arrived to tell him that Maurice was in Miss D'Arcy's room and that he wished to say goodbye. Douglas found his friend sitting disconsolately on the sofa and threw his arms round the younger boy's neck. In front of the matron, they kissed each other and wept openly. She saw nothing reprehensible in this, and, as Douglas put it, he and Maurice knew only too well that, `owing to the idiotic and rotten conventions of public-school life, he being younger than I, and our not being in the same House, we would hardly ever again be able to see each other except in the distance'. Except on one occasion later that term, when they stole a few whispered words in passing, they never spoke again while they were at school. The only times they met subsequently were when Douglas had left and, as an Old Wykehamist, was able to speak to Maurice when he visited Winchester from Oxford. However, they both knew that their irrevocable parting had come `on that summer morning in Miss D'Arcy's room'.
    Douglas was adamant that his relationship with Maurice Turner should not be misunderstood and made this clear to his readers in a way that he did not when commenting on other youthful relationships. `Our relationship,' he wrote, `(perhaps I ought to make it clear in this day, when any great friendship between persons of the same sex is generally labelled homosexual as a matter of course) was entirely innocent and idyllic, but it was certainly sentimental to the last degree, which was very far from being the case with most friendships between older and younger boys in my day at Winchester. Immorality there might be, but sentiment no!' In old age he would never have written in such detail of his time with Maurice Turner had their friendship been in any way `immoral'. It is fascinating, though: not only did it signal the high point in the succession of his encounters with other boys at Winchester, it set a precedent for his future relationships, with both men and women. Thirty-five years later, Douglas expressed his long and deeply felt convictions on the nature of love when he wrote, in his finest and most sustained sonnet sequence, `In Excelsis',
For love essentially must needs be chaste, And being contracted to unchastity (Even in marriage) knows essential loss, And falls into a malady of waste, Squand'ring the expended spirit's minted fee For that which, in the best, is worthless dross.
    Eighteen eighty-eight was Alfred Douglas's last year at Winchester, and without doubt his most constructive. During this time he cemented his friendships with people who remained close to him. Foremost among these was George Montagu, Encombe's `fag', who performed all the usual servile tasks that his position demanded of him. However, he clearly had an easier time of it than most others of his year, for particular attention was paid to him by Encombe's best friend. Four years younger than Douglas, Montagu was to become the 9th Earl of Sandwich, and Douglas described him as `a fair-haired, blue-eyed pretty boy with engaging manners'. He fell for the boy's charm during his last term, and since their mothers were great friends often stayed at the family's home, which doubtless fired his adoration. Montagu was a boy in whom Douglas could take an almost fatherly interest and he made a bee-line for him whenever he visited Winchester after he had gone up to Oxford.

During his penultimate term at Winchester, Douglas, with two friends, founded a school magazine to rival the Wykehamist. It was an achievement he remained proud of for the rest of his life. He, Edmund B. Phipps, who was in the same house, and Edmund W. Lidderdale, who was not, produced ten numbers of the Pentagram, which was intended to rival and mock the Wykehamist. It gave the boys an opportunity to experiment with their own literary ability. Of the five papers Douglas edited during his lifetime, as he admitted, `The Pentagram was the only one that ever showed a profit.' When the last number was published more copies were being sold than there were boys in the school because a number of old boys subscribed to it.
    The first issue opens with an explanation of the need for another school magazine: `The Wykehamist, with its active and sleeping editors, is a most respectable journal, whose slowness almost equals its respectability.' They also explained their choice of its title: the shape from which it took its name `keeps off evil spirits and bad luck generally'. The three editors wrote their often irreverent articles under pseudonyms. Phipps was `The Pelican', Lidderdale was `H.H.H.'  Half-way House Hag  and Douglas was `The Lost Chord'. The three, along with the odd outside contributor, put everything into their magazine from poetry to reports of school matches, but much of their material consists of typical public-schoolboy humour  recounting practical jokes and mishaps that have occurred to friends. There are some more general moments of humour: an article in the sixth issue follows the report of a cricket match against Eton in which Winchester were beaten by ten wickets on the first day and by an innings in the second. Since they could not fault the superiority of Eton on the field they ridiculed the spectators, presumably the Etonian parents. Among five typical examples of such a crowd is, `II  The Ignorant Party'.
    She: `Why do they change sides so often? It takes such a long time.'
    He: `Oh, that's because another bowler is going to bowl at the other end.'
She: `But how awfully slow of them! Why don't they bowl from the two ends at once?'
    One of Douglas's first prose contributions reveals in embryonic form his anecdotal ability: he describes how on their way back to their house one afternoon the `Pelican' and `Lost Chord' decided to chance their luck at a Try Your Strength machine. The `Lost Chord' had a penny, the `Pelican' did not, and after a failed attempt to extort the sum from two younger boys and a near descent into violence,
... one of the crowd that was now fast collecting, suggested that they should `pull, pull together'. No sooner said than done. A moment more, and the Chord had taken up the customary position, with his feet firmly pressed against the supports provided for that purpose, his hands firmly grasping the handles. In an instant the Pelican had seized him round the waist, and on the fall of the coin they got off well together. On entering the 'teens they tired perceptibly, but struggling gamely on, they had just reached 18, when the Lost Chord, whether overcome by the excitement of the moment, or distressed by the unwonted pressure from behind, suddenly loosed his hold! The sequel is too terrible for publication. There are many who will carry to the grave the memory of the heartrending scene, as the frenzied Fowl, maddened by remorse, bent o'er the prostrate victim of his unfortunate ambition.
    Douglas had his revenge on the `Pelican' (who had accidentally burnt one of his poems) by including in the same issue, when the unfortunate `bird' was ill, the following short report:
`Yes, I think that's good,' said the Pelican, as he finished reading over one of his own compositions. `By the way, how do you account for the enormous sale of this week's Pentagram?'  To him the Chord, `Well, I expect it had got about the School that you had gone down to Sick House, and so they thought you couldn't have written anything in the number!' and the bird was silent.
    The Pentagram also gave Douglas the opportunity to publish his verse. Those poems appear to have been his first and were never republished in any of his collections. In his Autobiography he recalled, `I began to write poetry in my first year at Oxford. I had before, in my school days, written verse, chiefly humorous, but none of it was good enough to survive.'
    However, the ones he included in the Pentagram are of some interest, chiefly because they show Douglas in an endearingly childish vein far removed from the austere work that came out of the traumas that beset him later. It is also of some interest that in these early efforts he is already writing in rigid forms:
Triolets
I I'm up to books at nine o'clock:
I haven't done my out of School:
Five past! good heavens, what a shock,
I'm up to books at nine o'clock.
My `toys' are shut? Well burst the lock.
Now my straw hat; `play up' you fool!
I'm up to books at nine o'clock,
I haven't done my out of School.
II You writing lines? Yes. So am I,
For shirking Chapel Sunday last.
Halloa! I hear another sigh:
You writing lines? Yes. So am I;
That's three of us; and here close by
Another scribbling very fast:
YOU writing lines? Yes. So am I,
For shirking Chapel Sunday last.
    Among the other rhymes and verse in the Pentagram, Douglas's stand out as by far the most sophisticated in style. Some are in a more fanciful though less humorous style, but all were dwarfed by one that appeared in the last issue, by Lionel Johnson, a cousin of Douglas.  It was a coup for the Pentagram's editors for it was signed `Ex-Editor of the Wykehamist', which indeed he had been. Although Douglas himself had no lasting admiration for `A Benediction', describing it in later years as `a very charming, half-whimsical, half-pathetic poem', Johnson thought highly enough of it to extend its five stanzas to seventy under the title `Winchester', in which guise it appeared as the last poem in his 1897 collection, Ireland, with other poems. The fifth stanza, which closed the Pentagram's final number, went:
Said is my say! so fare you well,
Lovers and lords of laughter!
(Platitude now.) What Time hereafter
May bring us, who can tell?
Then sigh we, alas!
And fill we the glass,
With Auld Lang Syne to the rafter!
    The last issue of the Pentagram opened with a prose essay, which proved to be uncannily prophetic:
Yes, the play is over; drop the curtain! put out the lights. To-morrow's sun shall look down upon empty houses, cricket fields bare of nets, classrooms closed, with only the eternal maps on the wall that never disappear, the maps that watch generation after generation come and go, that watch the hairs of their don gradually whiten, the maps that have heard such hundreds of jokes followed by the inevitable burst of applause; the maps that have grown impervious to the jokes, that sit and stare dull and flat, because they know that the applause must die out and float away to the ceiling, that the laugh must cease, and that in the years to come, few, very few hearts, will be as light and brimful of laughter as they are now.
