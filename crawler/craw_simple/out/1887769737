Admission and Ticketing
Admission to the Museum is free. From March through August, timed passes are required to enter the Permanent Exhibition. No passes are required for any other Museum exhibitions.
March through August: To prevent crowding during the busy season, the Museum distributes free timed passes for visits to the Permanent Exhibition during the months of March through August. These passes are available at the Museum on the day of your visit or online in advance (external link) . Passes for March, April, and May 2016 are available online beginning November 30, 2015; passes for June, July, and August 2016 are available online beginning February 28, 2016. The passes are printed with a one-hour time range, during which you may enter the Permanent Exhibition; passes are not valid for entry after that time. The earliest pass time for entry is 10–11 a.m. and the latest is 3:30–4:30 p.m. 
At the Museum, passes are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis beginning at 10 a.m. when the building opens. The pass line forms next to the building in the alley with benches. Staff distribute the passes from the 14th Street side of the alley to allow those with passes to proceed into the building. If you do not plan to visit the Permanent Exhibition, or if you already have a pass, you do not need to wait in the pass line. After staff have distributed passes to those in line, they bring any remaining passes inside the building to be distributed at the Information Desk.
Special Ticketing Considerations: The Museum distributes timed passes to the general public. One person may ask for up to 20 passes. With identification, members of the armed forces (including veterans and retirees), law enforcement and firefighting personnel, and federal government employees may obtain complimentary untimed passes for themselves and their families in person at the Information Desk on the day of their visit.
Online Advance Ticketing: Etix offers Museum passes in advance (external link)  for $1.00 (US) each. These are the same timed passes that the Museum distributes in person each day. If you purchase passes online, please remember to print them and bring them with you to the Museum.
September through February: Passes are not required to enter the Permanent Exhibition during these months. This is the best time of year to visit the Museum because the crowds are generally smaller. We continue to accept group reservations during this time.
Year-round: Passes are not required to enter the Museum building or to go to any of the special exhibitions , memorials, or programming.
Upon arrival at the Museum, all visitors must enter through security scanners. Please allow extra time for this.
